🔥 FIREBASE STORAGE RULES - TESTING ONLY
================================================================

⚠️ USE THIS FOR DEVELOPMENT/TESTING ONLY
⚠️ DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION - ALLOWS ANYONE TO UPLOAD

================================================================

HOW TO APPLY THESE RULES:

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project: "PlateLens" (or your project name)
3. Click on "Storage" in the left sidebar
4. Click on the "Rules" tab at the top
5. Copy and paste the rules below
6. Click "Publish"

================================================================

rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /meal-images/{imageId} {
      // Allow anyone to read meal images (public URLs)
      allow read: if true;

      // ⚠️ TESTING ONLY: Allow anyone to upload (no authentication)
      // TODO: Change to 'if request.auth != null' before production!
      allow write: if true;
    }
  }
}

// Note: Images are stored as WebP format (~60-80KB per image)
// File naming: meal-images/{timestamp}.webp

================================================================

WHAT THIS DOES:
- ✅ Anyone can read meal images (needed for public URLs to work)
- ⚠️ Anyone can write/upload images (INSECURE - for testing only!)

WHY THIS IS BAD FOR PRODUCTION:
- Anyone can spam your storage with images
- No cost control - malicious users could fill your storage
- No user accountability

BEFORE PRODUCTION:
- See TOPRODUCTION.txt
- Apply production rules from firebase-storage-rules-PRODUCTION.txt
