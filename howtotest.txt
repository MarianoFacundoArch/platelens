• To run PlateLens locally and test on your iOS/Android devices:

  1. Prep environment

  - In the repo root: npm install --global firebase-tools.
  - cd app && npm install (already done but rerun if deps changed).
  - cd functions && npm install && npm run build so the functions are ready.

  2. Start the backend

  - In /functions, run firebase emulators:start --only functions. This serves the API at http://127.0.0.1:5001/platelens-3333/us-central1/api.
  - If you want to hit it from a phone, use your Cloudflare tunnel: cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:5001. Copy the tunnel URL (e.g.,
    https://platelens-dev.example.com) and update EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL in app/.env to that URL. Restart the emulator if you change env
    values.

  3. Run the Expo app

  - Open a new terminal: cd app.
  - Ensure you’re logged into Expo: npx eas login.
  - Start Metro with tunneling so physical devices can connect: npx expo start --tunnel.
  - Install Expo Go on your device (iOS App Store or Google Play). Scan the QR code shown in the terminal. The app will load and walk through
    splash → notifications → auth → onboarding → plan → paywall → app screens, hitting your tunneled backend.

  4. Test specific flows

  - Push notifications: once your Expo access token is in .env (already done), call the test endpoint:
    curl -X POST https://<your-api-url>/v1/notify/test -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"uid":"test-
    user","title":"Ping","body":"PlateLens reminder"}'
    Make sure you've registered a device via POST /v1/devices/register in the app first.
  - RevenueCat: until offerings are configured, the paywall still uses the mock setStatus('active'). After you set up products/offerings in
    App Store/Play/RevenueCat, swap in real Purchases.purchasePackage logic and run through the paywall in Expo Go using a sandbox Apple/Google
    account.
  - Backend endpoints: with the emulator running you can hit them via Postman/cURL to confirm responses, e.g. curl http://127.0.0.1:5001/
    platelens-3333/us-central1/api/v1/config.

  5. Device builds (optional)

  - Once happy in Expo Go, generate native binaries:
      - npx eas build -p ios --profile development for a TestFlight-ready build (requires Apple CLI login and certificates).
      - npx eas build -p android --profile development to get an APK/AAB.
  - After those succeed, you can submit with eas submit -p ios / -p android using the Play service account JSON from auth.txt.

  Let me know if you run into any errors starting the emulator or Expo tunnel. Once we wire the RevenueCat offerings and Apple Sign In
  credentials, I’ll help integrate the final purchase/auth flows.
